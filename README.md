# YouLag

YouLag is a small app that notifies the user about Connecting/Disconnecting or even lagging in the network. Useful for online competitive gamers.

Using Java as a programming language and JavaFX for GUI. I made this simply to practice.
It is useful for competitive online gamers to know when they have internet connection issues. During a game they might not notice, so a small cross-platform application that continuously monitors the network connection reliability and that notifies the user with a voice sound effect should be very useful in this case scenario.

To use this application, make sure to have a JRE installed and you are good to go.
You can download the file in the Bin directory "YouLag.jar" and launch it to start using this application.
However for anyone who wants to contribute more to this idea can start by looking at how simple and clean is its source code.
